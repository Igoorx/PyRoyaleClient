  Yes, now we are <img src="https://i.imgur.com/37x7FpP.png" width="170" height="40" />! (never mind, we moved our servers and got rid of https, we'll re-add it once we start handling passwords)<br><br>

  When you're on the podium, you can now use the jump button to return to the lobby. Also works with gamepad!<br><br>
  When you're on the podium, you can now see the statistics of your performance in the match.<br>
  <div class='note'>For now the only stats you'll see are players killed and coins collected.</div>
  Star power now gets cancelled when you touch the flagpole.<br><br>

  <h1>Version 1.0.1</h1>
  Jun 16 - Performance Patch<br>
  Player count reduced to 75 from 99<br>
  <div class='note'>
  Both the server and the game client struggle to handle a full 99 players so I'm reducing it for now to help alleviate performance issues on both the backend server and the client renderer.<br>
  I also feel like 99 players is a bit overly chaotic right at the start, so hopefully this will make it more manageable.<br>
  After all... Most battle royales spread their players over a large area. This game dumps them all in 1 place.
  </div>
  Renderer culling changes<br>
  <div class='note'>Small change to slightly improve framerates.</div>
  Experimental Server Performance Improvements<br>
  <div class='note'>Made some changes to how the server writes game data to clients. Should be thread safe but may cause problems. I'll roll this back if it breaks things.</div>
  Improved support for browsers that don't have a gamepad api<br>
  <div class='note'>Hopefully fixes a few web browsers that like... no one uses...</div>
  Fixed num0 key being wrong keycode<br><br>
  Added more stuff you can't get in the lobby<br><br>
  Planned stuff:<br>
  <div class='note'>Hopefully will be able to add some new features soon.<br>Most requested features are: touch controls, squads, and rebindable controls.<br>Please look forward to it.</div>
